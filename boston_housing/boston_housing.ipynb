    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: ** Home price will be related to RM because more rooms means a bigger house, and bigger houses cost more money. However, the neighborhood a house is in matters, too. We can tell how good a neighborhood is by looking at the neighbors. If a large percent of them are working class, this implies the neighborhood is less expensive to own a home in, and should corrleate with smaller home prices. The quality of nearby schools also makes a neighborhood more or less desirable. A high PTRATIO ratio means the teachers provide less individual attention to the students, makikng the neighborhood less desirable to homeowners raising kids. Like LSTAT, PTRATIO will be inversely proportional to home price. "

    "**Answer: ** The k-fold cross-validation technique splits the training data into k subsets. That way, you can leave out one subset for testing, train on all the others, and repeat k times. The training always occurs on k-1 subsets of the data, so your training dataset isn't too small, but you still get k unique datasets to try. This is perfect for Grid Search because you need a way of evaluating each hyper-parameter combination, but can't use the test dataset yet. Grid Search can try a different hyper-parameter combination on each of the k outputs from the split. And because the whole training dataset is never used at once, you always have some reserved data points to test and make sure you are not overfitting, while still preserving the true testing dataset for final model validation."

To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

Plus, we'll need much more than three paramters.
